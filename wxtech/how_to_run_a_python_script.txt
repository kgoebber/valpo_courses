First copy bloop.py to your own wxtech directory using the following command:

cp /home/kgoebber/wxtech/bloop.py /home/<username>/wxtech/bloop.py

Be sure to replace <username> with your own username (don't put in the carrot brackets)

Now navigate to your folder where you copied bloop.py and then follow the instructions below.

To run a python script you type "python <scriptname>" 

For this question you will want to use the following command:

python bloop.py

After running the script a new file will be in your directory: 'bloop.out'.

First, rename the file "firstname_lastname_wonderous.txt"
 (where firstname and lastname refer to your own...for example
    'kevin_goebbert_wonderous.txt').

Then answer the following question:

Are all of the numbers between 1 and 100 wonderous?
(Hint: you'll want to read the text file that is created after running the python script.)

Finally, copy your renamed file you created running the bloop.py program to
/home/kgoebber/wxtech/scavenger/answers/kevin

Once you have done that, you have completed the scavenger hunt! Rejoice!
