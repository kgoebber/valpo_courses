    "# The Influence of SST on Midlatitude Cyclones\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many factors that can influence the the life cycle of a midlatitude cyclone. For cyclones that form and track along coastal regions of the southern and eastern US, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) can have a profound impact on the strength and speed of intensification of a given cyclone. In order to begin to understand the relationship we'll want to look at data that represent both the atmospheric strength of a cyclone with some information about ocean conditions. Where we have warmer SSTs there is greater capacity for moisture just above the ocean surface, which in turn can lead to greater latent heat release. It's the latent heat release that can strongly modify the environment to amplify atmospheric processes and thus produce a deeper (stronger) midlatitude cyclone in a very short amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's investigate a case to determine whether SSTs appear to play a major role in the life cycle of a midlatitude cyclone. \n",
