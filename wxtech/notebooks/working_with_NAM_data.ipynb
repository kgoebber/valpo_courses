    "Here we are plotting 300-hPa geopotential heights and winds. At that level, the winds should be geostrophic, meaning that the winds barbs should be parallel to the contours of geopotential height. When we look toward the edge of the map this is where we see that the wind barbs are not clearly conforming to geostrophic balance. The winds are crossing the geopotential height contours at an angle that they shouldn't be. This behaviour is due to the curvature of the projection not aligning with the assumptions made to plot the wind barbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily we have an easy solution built in to the MetPy declarative syntax to convert the stored grid relative winds and make them earth relative for plotting. The attribute to set as part of the `BarbPlot()` class is `earth_relative`. We need to tell MetPy that our winds are NOT earth relative. This is a boolean setting, such that for our NAM winds `earth_relative` should be set to `False`."
