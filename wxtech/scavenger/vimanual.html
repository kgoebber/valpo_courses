<h2>vi Editor (visual display editor)</h2>
 
Unlike most word processors you may be used to, vi does not use modifier keys 
in command sequences.  Typically on a PC, you would use some combination
of function keys, alt, shift and ctrl.  Vi was written to run on a text based
system, and so almost entirely uses no modifier keys for commands.

<p>

Vi has two operational modes:  COMMAND mode and INPUT mode.

<p>

When you start vi, you are in COMMAND mode.  When you add, insert, replace, 
or change text, you need to enter INPUT mode.  Pressing the ESC (Escape) key at 
any time, will return you to the command mode.  If you are already in command
mode, your terminal will simply beep you, telling you so.

<p>
 
For the next several sections, we will be in command mode only.  We will
learn about the input mode once we know how to navigate around in a file.

<p>

<a name="starting"</a>
<h2>Starting vi</h2>
 
To invoke vi with a new (blank) file, simply type "vi" at the prompt:
 
<p>

<tt>>> prompt% vi </tt>

<p>

You should get a screen with the cursor blinking at the top left, and  
tildes "~" along the left margin.  The tildes indicate that those lines  
are completely void of any characters (spaces, tabs, returns included).

<p>
 
To edit an existing file, type "vi" followed by the filename:
 
<p>

<tt>>> prompt% vi filename </tt>
 
<p>

You should see your file, along with a status line along the bottom 
stating the name of the file, the number of lines, and the number of 
characters in that file:

<p>

Example:   <tt> "pton.list" 399 lines, 22543 characters</tt>

<p>
 
To view a file only (you will not be making any changes, or want to prevent 
any accidental changes) type "view" followed by the filename:

<p>

<tt>>> prompt% view filename</tt>

<p>
 
<a name="cursor"></a>
<h2>Cursor Keys</h2>
You can move the cursor around using the movement keys.  "h" and "l" moves 
the cursor left and right;  "j" and "k" moves down and up.
 
<p>

<pre>
                                  (up)    
     
                                   k         
                   (left)     h         l    (right)
                                   j       
 
                                 (down)
</pre>

<p>

NOTE:  The arrow keys work in vi as well, but not all terminals may have 
them.  In any case using hjkl is recommended, since it keeps your hands on 
the keyboard, and so you don't have to reposition your hand everytime you 
move the cursor.

Alternative keys: 

<p>
 
<pre>
                                  (up)    
     
                                   -         
             (left)  Backspace            (spacebar) (right)
                                   +       
 
                                 (down)
</pre>

<a name="movement"></a>
<h2>Word and Line Movement Keys</h2>
If you're editing a file that's primarily text (that is, words and 
sentences and not a ton of computer code) there are more convenient 
ways to move around than one column/row at a time.

<p>

We're still in command mode.  To move to the beginning of the next word, 
type "w".  To move to the beginning of the previous word, type "b".  You 
can also move to the end of the next word, type "e".

<pre>
>> Beginning of next word      w
>> Beginning of prev word      b
</pre>

<p>

You can also jump to the start and end of lines if you're somewhere in the 
middle.  0 (zero) or ^ (caret) jumps to the start, "$" jumps to the end.

<pre>
>> Start of line               0 (zero) or ^
>> End of line                 $
</pre>

<p>
 
If you're a fan of run-on sentences, you might want to jump from sentence
to sentence.  Use "(" to move to the start of the previous sentence and ")" 
to move to the start of the next sentence.

<pre>
>> Start of previous sentence   (
>> Start of next sentence       )
</pre>

<p>

We can jump in even larger units.  Using "{" and "}", we can jump to
previous and next paragraphs.

<pre>
>> Start of previous paragraph  {
>> Start of next paragraph      }
</pre>

<p>

Also, if you hit RETURN at any time, you will move to the beginning of the 
*next* line down.

<pre>
>> Start of following line:  RETURN
</pre>

<p>
There are also several commands to jump to relative locations on the screen 
and in the file:
 
<pre>
>> Move to top of screen         H (home)
>> Move to middle of screen      M (middle)
>> Move to last line of screen   L (last)
</pre>

<p>

One other useful command, is "G", which let's you jump to the end of your
file:

<pre>
>> Last line in file             G
</pre>

<p>
 
In the next section we'll see how to jump to any line in a file.

<a name="count"></a>
<h2>Number Counts</h2>
Much of the time even using the word movement keys is too slow.  If we
could jump any number of words/lines instead of having to press the keys
each time, things would be much easier.  Vi, therefore, provides a way
to repeat commands. 

<pre>
>> To repeat command X, n times:  nX
</pre>

<p>

Examples:<br>

<pre>
To move 10 lines down         10j
To move 4 characters left     4h
To move 5 words right         5w
</pre>

<p>

Number counts can be used with almost all movement and editing commands.  
As you know, "G" by itself moves to the last line.  To move to the first 
line of a file, type "1G".  To move to the nth line, type "nG".

<pre>
>> First line in file:  1G
</pre>

<p>

Example:  45th line in file   45G
 
<a name="cancel"></a> 
<h2>Cancelling Commands</h2>
If at any time, you want to cancel a number count or any other command
before you finish typing it, you can always hit ESCAPE.

<a name="status"></a>
<h2>Status Line</h2>
Sometimes when you jump around in a file a lot, you lose track of where you 
are.  CTRL-G will give your current position and the file name you're editing 
at the bottom of the screen.  It should look something like:

<p>
 
<tt>"filename" line 20 of 399 --5%--</tt>
 
<a name="scroll">
<h2>Scroll Commands</h2>
When you're simply reading through a file, often times you just want to 
page through the text and not make any changes.  Having to type "40j" every 
page would be too tedious.
 
<p>

Fortunately, vi has a set of scroll commands.  To scroll down a screen 
(forward), press CTRL-f.  To scroll back a screen (backwards), press CTRL-
b.  To scroll up half a screen, CTRL-u.  To scroll down half a screen, 
CTRL-d.

<pre>
>> Scroll forward one screen    CTRL-f
>> Scroll back one screen       CTRL-b        

>> Scroll up half a screen      CTRL-u
>> Scroll down half a screen    CTRL-d
</pre>

<a name="delete"></a>
<h2>Delete Commands</h2>
To delete a single character, type "x". This deletes the character directly 
under the cursor and moves the remaining text to the right one space to the 
left.

<pre>
>> To delete a single character at cursor      x
</pre>

We can combine number counts with "x" as well:

<p>

Example:<br>
delete 4 characters: 4x

<p>
 
Of course, if you want to delete large sections of text, typing "9999x" is 
a bit unwieldy.  Fortunately (as you may have guessed), vi has another 
delete command, "d".

<p>
 
By now, you know how to move an distance in any direction by combining a 
number with a movement key.  The delete commands work in a similar fashion.

<p>

"d" is always used with another command, never by itself.  We need to tell
it which direction you want to delete and how far in that direction.  We 
already know how to move any distance in any direction, right?  Now all we 
do is combine  "d" with any movement key and we've learned almost all the 
delete commands.

<pre>
>> To delete from cursor to start of next word         dw
>> To delete from cursor to end of line                d$
>> To delete from current line to bottom of screen     dL
>> To delete one character before cursor               dh
</pre>

(Note:  "dl" works to delete one character at the cursor, but this is 
exactly what "x" does.)

<p>

Vi does provide a short cut for d$.  You can use "D" to the same effect.

<pre>
>> Shortcut delete from cursor to end of line     D
</pre>

<p>
 
To delete the current line, instead of having to type "^d$" (move to 
start of line and delete to the end), vi has a shortcut command, "dd".

<pre>
>> To delete the current line   dd
</pre>
 
Of course, "d" is just like any other command, so we can combine a number 
count with any "d" command.  

<p>

Examples:  
Delete three words: 3dw  
Delete three words: d3w

<p>

Two ways?  Which one is right?  Vi isn't picky.  They're both right.  
Deleting three words once (d3w) is the same as delete one word three 
times (3dw).

<p>

Now...what command would you use to delete 5 lines starting from the 
current line?  

<p>
 
The expected way: 5dd
Alternate way: 4dj

<p>
 
Why "4dj"?  Remember, deletion always occurs relative to the cursor 
position when we give it a direction.  So "4dj" deletes the current line 
and the 4 lines below it.  Similarly, "4dk" deletes 5 lines, the current line 
and the 4 lines above it.

<p>
 
Other delete commands:

<pre>
>> Delete from current line to end of file     dG
>> Delete from current line to start of file   d1G
>> Delete line 5                               5Gdd 
    (this is merely combining two commands, 5G and dd)
</pre> 

<a name="input"></a>
<h2>Input/Editing Commands (finally!)</h2>
Now that we know how to navigate through files and delete text from them 
it's time we learn how to insert text.  There are six input modes:  append, 
insert, change, open, substitute, and replace.  Each mode has two 
invocations, lowercase first letter and uppercase first letter (i.e., "a" 
and "A" for append).  
 
<p>

Remember that we always start in command mode.  As soon as you type any
of the input commands (except "r" replace) you stay in input mode until 
you hit ESCAPE.  So in order for you to go back any make changes in what 
you've typed, just press ESC and move to where you have to go and enter 
the appropriate input mode.

<p>

To enter text, use either insert (i or I) or append (a or A).

<pre>
>> Insert text before the cursor    i 
>> Insert text after the cursor     a

>> Insert text at start of line     I
>> Insert text at end of line       A
</pre>

Number counts, of course, can be used to do repeated insertions of text.

<pre>
>> Insert 5 "newtext"       5inewtext<ESC> 

Example:  insert 5 copies of "hello"      5ihello<ESC>
</pre>

If you need to insert blank lines, use open (o or O).

<pre>
>> Insert blank line below current line     o
>> Insert blank line above current line     O
</pre>

(Just think of "lowercase = lower/below"  and "uppercase = uppper/above".)

<p>

Often times you want to type over something instead of having to insert
new text and then delete old text.  To do this we use change.

<pre>
>> Change from cursor to end of line     C
>> Change a word to "newtext"            cwnewtext
>> Change entire line                    cc  (vi will blank out the entire
                                              line)
</pre>

Note that when you use "C" vi will change the last character in the line
to "$" to show you what how far your change in the text will delete the
old text.

<p>

Similarly for "cw", vi will change the last character of the word you
intend to change into "$".

<p>

Replace and substitute are fairly similar to change, although with subtle
differences in usage.

<pre>
>> Replace character at cursor with x        rx
>> Replace (overwrite) from cursor onward    R

Examples replace with 5 "g"'s             5rg
</pre>

Note that "r" with or without a number count will replace and then return 
you to command mode.  "R" stays in input mode.

<pre>
>> Substitute one or more characters for a single character    snewtext
>> Substitute entire line                                      S
</pre>

<a name="search"></a>
<h2>Search (see also <a href="#searchreplace">Search and Replace</a> later
in this section)</h2>

To jump a string or substring anywhere in your file, type "/" and the
string you want to search for.

<pre>
>> Search for a string "foo"     /foo
</pre>

This search will move your cursor to the next occurrence (forwards  
search) of "foo" if it exists.  You can jump to the next occurrence  
either by typing "/" by itself, or "n".  If you want to search backwards,
use "N".

<pre>
>> Repeat search forward     n or /
>> Repeat search backward    N
</pre>

If you are at the last occurrence of a string, a repeat search forward (n
or /) will start search again from the top of the file. If the pattern
doesn't exist, it will give you the message "Pattern not found".

<a name="copypaste"></a>
<h2>Copy, Paste, Undo, Repeat</h2>
Vi also has the capacity to copy and paste text.   Copying text is much
like deleting text.  You give it the copy command and then a direction
and distance in that direction.  The copy command is "y" (yank).

<pre>
>> Copy current line     yy  or Y
>> Copy a word           yw
>> Copy 4 words          y4w  or 4yw
</pre>

Now to paste what you've just copied, use the paste command, "p", to
paste after the cursor, "P" to paste before the cursor.

<pre>
>> Paste after cursor    p
>> Paste before cursor   P
</pre>

What about cut n' pasting?  You, in fact, already know how to cut and
paste.  The delete commands automatically save the text you last deleted
into the paste buffer.  It's important to note that using the "x" command
only deletes one character at a time, and therefore vi only saves each
character individually.  If you type "x" repeatedly and try to paste,
you will only paste one letter.

<p>

However, if you use a number count with x, like "25x", paste *will* insert
all 25 characters.

<pre>
>> Reversing two lines      ddp
>> Reverse two characters   xp
</pre>

To paste what you previously pasted again, but somewhere else, go to
your next point of insertion, and type Ctrl-@.

<pre>
>> Insert previously pasted text here        ^@ (max of 128 chars)
</pre>

You can also paste text without having to move your cursor to the location
you want to paste to.

<pre>
>> Paste current line after line 5  :t 5
>> Paste line x after line 5        :xt 5
>> Paste line 9 after line 5        :9t 5
</pre>

If you want to move the text, instead of just pasting, use :m.

<pre>
>> Move current line after line 5   :m 5
>> Move line x after line 5         :xt 5
>> Move line 9 after line 5         :9t 5
</pre>

Of course, all this cutting and pasting would be rather dangerous if we 
couldn't reverse the changes if we don't like it.  So of course vi has
an undo command, and as you'd expect, it's the letter "u".

Undo comes in two forms, like all the other commands:  lowercase and
uppercase.

<pre>
>> Undo last modification                u
>> Undo all changes on a given line      U
</pre>

"U" will undo all changes on a given line *only* if you keep the cursor on
that line.  As soon as you move the cursor to another line, you cannot
undo all changes on that line.  You can still undo the last change 
however using "u". 

If you want to repeat the last editing command you did, use "."

<a name="excommands"></a>
<h2>ex Commands (saving files, opening files, quiting vi)</h2>
Before vi was written, the only way to edit files was to use the line
editor, ex.  You had could only process one line at a time.  Nowadays,
there's no need to rough it anymore, but vi carries over some of the
file saving, opening, and quitting commands.

<p>

The ex commands are all invoked with the colon, ":".  Once you type
":", vi will give you the ex prompt ":" in the lower left corner.

<p>
<b>Saving and Quiting</b><br>
Once you finish your editing, you'll want to save your work and exit vi.
There happen to three ways to quit and save.

<pre>
>> To write (save) to file and quit  -->   :wq
                                            :x
                                            ZZ   (no colon)
</pre>

<b>Saving only</b><br>
Often times you'll want to save your work while still working on it
(in case you accidentally get logged out, or the machine crashes, or
you somehow lose your changes).  To do this, simply type ":w".

<pre>
>> To write (save) to file     -->   :w
>> To write (save) to newfile  -->   :w filename
</pre>

Vi protects your files, so in case you try to write to a file that exists,
it will give you a message:   "foo"  File exists - use "w! foo" to overwrite

<p>

If you want to overwrite the existing file, then you use :w! filename

<pre>
>> To write over existing file  -->  :w! filename
</pre>

<b>Quiting only</b></br>
If you haven't made any changes and simply want to exit, just type ":q".
If you *have* made changes, but do NOT want to save them, and you want
to exit, then type ":q!".

<pre>
>> To quit                       --> :q
>> To quit (don't save changes)  --> :q!
</pre>

<b>Shell escapes</b><br>
If you need to execute a UNIX command while in vi you can make use of
the shell escape.  Just type ":! command".  Vi will execute your command
and then return to your editing after you hit RETURN.

<pre>
>> Execute UNIX command  -->   :! command
</pre>

Shell escapes are useful for checking on filenames in your directory, or
maybe reading mail that has recently come in.

<pre>
Example,  :! ls
</pre>

(see UNIX help section on alternate ways to do this, re: suspending jobs)

<p>

<b>Opening files</b><br>
Often times you'll be editing a series of files.  Having to type "vi file1"
and exiting with :wq each time can be a hassle.  If you know the name of
your other files, you can open those files from inside vi, by typing
":e file2".

<pre>
>> Open another file  -->  :e filename
</pre>

If you have made changes to your current file, you need to save your
changes before using ":e" to open another file.  However, as with :w and :q,
you can override this by using ":e!"

<pre>
>> Open another file (don't save most recent changes)  -->  :e! filename
</pre>

<b>Inserting files</b><br>
If you write a lot of mail message or post a lot of articles to USENET,
many times you'll want to append or insert other documents into your
letter or article.  To do this, move your cursor where you want the
file, and type ":r filename"

<pre>
>> Insert file at cursor position -->  :r filename
</pre>

<b>Status line</b><br>
We saw back in the status line section that CTRL-g gives your file's
attributes.  An alternative way is to use ":f".  This command also 
informs you if the file has been changed since you opened it with vi.

<pre>
>> Show file status  -->   :f
</pre>

<a name="searchreplace"></a>
<h2>Search and Replace</h2>
This is about as complicated as it gets in vi, since search and replace 
sytnax is taken from the UNIX sed (stream editor) command.  

<pre>
>> Global search and replace  -->  :1,$ s/old/new/g
                                     ^  ^  ^   ^  ^
In english, this means:              |  |  |   |  |
                                     |  |  |   |  |
            From 1 to $ (end of file)   |  |   |  |
                                        |  |   |  |
            substitute -----------------/  |   |  |
                                           |   |  |
            occurrences of "old" ----------/   |  |
                                               |  |
            with occurrences of "new" --------/   |
                                                  |
            globally (i.e., all instances of "old")
</pre>

I won't go into details on using sed in this section (see the UNIX sections
on sed and regular expressions), but you can easily change the range to
search and replace from by changing "1" and "$" to your needs.
