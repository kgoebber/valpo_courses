Well done! 
You have found this file.

Now, go to /archive/courses/wxtech/scavenger/pony 

In that directory, look for a hidden file with a name
that suggests you're on the right track.  Follow
the directions in that file.

Hint: a hidden file is a file whose name begins with a period (".")(e.g. ".htaccess").  You might want to read the help manual for the command "ls".
