Good job! Now keep going!

You'll find a simple python program to tell if a number is wonderous. 
It loops through 1 to 1000 and determines whether the number is wonderous
Copy this program to your wxtech directory with the following command:

cp /archive/courses/wxtech/bloop.py bloop.py

Now find a file that will tell you how to run a python script. This one won't be hidden!
